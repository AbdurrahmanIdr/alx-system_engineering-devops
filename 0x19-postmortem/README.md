# Web Stack Outage Postmortem

## Issue Summary

On June 9, 2023, our website experienced an outage that lasted for approximately 14 hours. During this time, the website was intermittently slow and unresponsive, resulting in a degraded user experience. Approximately 30% of the users were affected, leading to increased bounce rates and customer complaints.

## Timeline

The issue was first detected by our monitoring system at 10:15 AM UTC. The operations team investigated the issue and suspected a network or load balancer problem. They optimized the load balancer configuration and scaled up the backend servers, but this did not resolve the issue.

At 1:00 PM UTC, the incident was escalated to the development team. The developers suspected that an issue with a recent deployment was causing the problem. They analyzed logs and code changes, and they realized that a recent database schema update had caused inefficient queries and degraded performance.

The issue was escalated to the database administration team at 8:00 PM UTC. The database administrators identified a missing index on a frequently queried table, which was causing poor query performance. The missing index was added to the database at 1:00 AM UTC, and the issue was resolved.

## Root Cause and Resolution

The root cause of the outage was a missing index on a frequently queried table in the database. The inefficient queries resulting from the missing index caused increased response times and degraded system performance. To resolve the issue, the database administration team added the missing index to the table, optimizing query execution and improving overall system responsiveness.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

To prevent similar outages in the future, the following measures will be implemented:

1. Regular code reviews: Developers will review code changes more thoroughly to identify potential 2. performance issues before deployments.
3. Automated performance testing: Load and stress tests will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to catch performance regressions early.
4. Query optimization: Database administrators will conduct regular reviews of query performance, identifying missing indexes or inefficient queries.
5. Improved monitoring: Enhancements will be made to the monitoring system to provide more granular insights into application performance and database queries.
6. Incident response training: Operations and development teams will undergo training sessions to improve incident detection, investigation, and escalation processes.

## Tasks
### Patch the monitoring system to provide better visibility into database query performance.
### Conduct a comprehensive code review of the recent deployment to identify any other potential performance issues.
### Perform a thorough review of the database schema and query performance, addressing any identified inefficiencies.
### Enhance the alerting system to notify relevant teams in a timely manner during performance-related incidents.

## Conclusion
We apologize for the inconvenience caused by the outage. We are committed to preventing similar outages in the future, and we believe that the measures outlined above will help us achieve this goal.
